Kylo Ren Neopixel Lightsaber:

Kylo Ren lightsaber code for Neopixels (WS2812) using FastLED. There are 6 LED strips, 2 long ones in the main blade, and 4 short ones (strips doubled up in each blade). Since I was tight on space in the saber, I ran one control wire to the two strips in the long blade, and one control wire to the four strips in cross gaurd. I also added in a party mode with some FastLED patterns, you can switch between with a button.
